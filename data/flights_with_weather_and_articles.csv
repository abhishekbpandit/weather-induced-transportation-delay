Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",7,2,9,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",4,29,21,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",6,27,19,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",11,13,16,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",8,10,14,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",12,20,10,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",5,4,18,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",5,13,19,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",1,18,11,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",2,14,9,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",5,4,22,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",10,28,16,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",10,17,20,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",3,21,7,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",3,13,18,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",7,23,10,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",4,10,13,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",2,4,9,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",11,29,16,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",12,14,8,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",9,14,21,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",11,10,11,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",6,26,16,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",3,16,9,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",5,28,17,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",8,22,21,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",7,18,8,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",6,17,14,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",10,17,9,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",7,3,9,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",11,6,14,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",11,17,21,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",2,18,7,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",3,21,11,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",12,9,8,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",4,10,20,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",5,29,10,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",3,31,14,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",10,24,21,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",9,7,15,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",5,9,16,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",8,26,15,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",4,17,13,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",3,17,17,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",6,26,6,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",6,11,19,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",5,31,12,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",3,2,14,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",11,14,10,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",12,16,16,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",7,15,14,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",12,7,8,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",1,25,10,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.', 'NewsNYC airports cancel, delay hundreds of flights during third day of stormsBy Ramsey KhalifehPublished Jun 27, 2023Modified Jun 27, 2023ShareFacebookTwitterRedditEmailNever miss a story\xa0Email address By submitting your information, you\'re agreeing to receive communications from New York Public Radio in accordance with our  Terms . \xa0Catalina Gonella/GothamistBy Ramsey KhalifehPublished Jun 27, 2023Modified Jun 27, 2023ShareFacebookTwitterRedditEmailWe rely on your support to make local news available to all Make your contribution now and help Gothamist thrive in 2024.

Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",11,21,6,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",4,23,10,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",8,9,11,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",7,13,12,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",9,9,16,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",6,29,20,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",4,6,17,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",3,16,8,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",2,11,16,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",7,31,22,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",6,9,11,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",9,25,20,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",5,18,14,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",8,3,12,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",6,13,9,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",9,19,12,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",11,22,15,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",1,19,21,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",6,15,18,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",10,3,17,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",8,18,19,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",6,12,22,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",11,15,14,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",10,13,7,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",6,9,18,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",10,31,9,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",3,19,8,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",8,1,11,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",3,7,20,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",11,17,21,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",6,11,9,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",11,22,6,0

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",11,21,7,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",8,8,11,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",12,10,16,0

Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donationsFor the third consecutive day, New York City’s three major airport hubs are experiencing the nation’s highest numbers of flight cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware data.As of Tuesday morning, Newark Liberty experienced more than 300 cancellations and 96 delays; LaGuardia had more than 120 cancellations and 67 delays; and JFK had more than 60 cancellations and 171 delays, based on FlightAware statistics. Those numbers have continued to climb in recent days.Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK were hampered by local thunderstorms Monday and the National Weather Service said another day of rain and storms could be expected Tuesday, although not as severe.United currently ranks highest on FlightAware for cancellations and delays nationally. A spokesperson said the thunderstorms have made airline travel ""very challenging"" over the past three days.The Federal Aviation Administration said flights into LaGuardia were delayed by an hour, on average.Data from the US Department of Transportation ranks LaGuardia and Newark Liberty as one of the lowest ranking ports in on-time arrivals and departures.In 2020, Newark ranked lowest in a list of 30 major US airports and LaGuardia at the third lowest.Newark and LaGuardia also ranked in the bottom five of major U.S. airports for on-time departures in 2020, based on the same US Department of Transportation statistics.Yet the issues of flight delays and cancellations have been a national problem this past week. On Monday alone, there were more than 2,200 canceled flights and more than 8,700 delayed flights across the US, according to FlightAware data, a higher than normal amount.At Seattle Tacoma International Airport, travelers have been stranded overnight trying to get home to New York area airports. On Tuesday morning, security lines extended out to parking garages outside the terminal.More passengers voiced their frustrations via Twitter on Tuesday after experiencing “purgatory.”John Davidson, who is currently stuck in Newark, said that after two days of delays, “we can’t get out.”Another user said that United Airlines has “held us hostage for over 24 hours.”Joe Solano, told Gothamist via Twitter on Monday that his father died and he was trying to get to family in New Orleans, but dealt with multiple delays and cancellations.Even Walt Nauta, a former aide to Donald Trump who was due to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday on classified document charges alongside the former president, had to reschedule because he couldn\'t catch a flight from Newark.According to Nauta’s defense attorney, he spent eight hours at the airport and three hours on the tarmac.Catalina Gonella contributed reporting from Seattle.This story has been updated with additional information.TaggedstormstransportationairportsweatherRamsey KhalifehRamsey Khalifeh is a general assignment reporter on the NYC Accountability desk covering the city\'s most powerful institutions and the work they do (or don\'t).

Still, that\'s a major decrease from Monday\'s chaos, when more than 11,000 flights were either delayed or canceled because of severe weather and air traffic control staffing issues.United Airlines was once again faring the worst of the US domestic airlines. About 16% of its schedule, or 467 flights, was canceled and another 37%, or 1,062 flights, was delayed just before 6 pm ET. Republic Airways, which operates feeder flights for American Airlines, Delta and United, had 35% of its schedule canceled (333 flights).The four US airports most affected Tuesday afternoon are all major hubs for either United or Delta: New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty, both of New York City\'s airports (LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy) and Boston\'s Logan. But the problems weren\'t limited to the Northeast. There were 17 airports spread across the country, from San Francisco to Orlando, which had at least 20% of their flights delayed according to FlightAware.More than 40 million people in the Northeast and Central Plains are at risk of severe storms on Tuesday. The majority of people at risk are located in the Northeast, including Philadelphia and Washington, DC, where a Level 1 of 5 threat has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center. A level 3 of 5 threat, of severe weather, is highlighted for parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Wichita and Tulsa.Scattered thunderstorms are again expected east of a cold front from the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the Northeast, leading to the possibility of even more flight delays and cancellations later.Some of these afternoon storms could produce damaging wind gusts, and heavy rain from these storms could produce isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over parts of southeastern New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania.United CEO blames FAA for weekend delaysSince travel problems started to mount on Saturday there have been more than 5,000 flights to, from or within the United States canceled according to FlightAware\'s midday stats at midday Tuesday, and another 28,500 delayed.While weather is part of the reason for the problem, a lack of adequate staffing at the air traffic control centers run by the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of capacity at US airlines also come into play.That adds to the problem, making it difficult for the system to handle disruptions caused by bad weather, and for passengers to find seats on new flights when their original flight is canceled.The head of United Airlines, in a strongly worded memo to staff, blamed the FAA\'s air traffic controller staffing problems for ""unprecedented challenges"" this past weekend that impacted ""over 150,000 customers on United alone.""""The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in an internal company memo shared with CNN.Kirby says that on Saturday, the FAA reduced arrival rates at its major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport by 40 percent and departure rates by 75 percent, which was ""almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.""""It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,"" Kirby said. ""And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.""Kirby says he will be meeting with the FAA and Department of Transportation ""to discuss what steps FAA can take in the immediate term to prevent this from happening again this summer.""The FAA responded Tuesday morning, saying ""we will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.""City News Service and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a pandemic-era record.Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast over the past few days and frustrations are running high. \n\nAirports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey — all hubs for United — were seeing the most delays on Thursday, according to FlightAware.By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight day. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline’s struggles in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is severely understaffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They have really been struggling this week, even relative to other U.S. airlines,” Buttigieg told CNN. “But where we do agree is that there need to be more resources for air traffic control.”The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but they won’t be ready to help this summer, much less this weekend.\n\nThe leader of United’s union pilots — who are locked in difficult contract negotiations — blamed management for the disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a crew-scheduling system.“While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA, weather and everything in between, further flight delays are a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines executives,” Garth Thompson said.United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have been put on hold for three hours or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Stories\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas your flight canceled amid bad weather? What you need to know about rebooking, refunds and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA leader warns of summer travel ‘havoc’ if GOP cuts pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS to propose new rules for airline cancellations, delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The airline actually ‘lost’ crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation,” said Ken Diaz, president of the flight attendants’ group at United. He said the company scheduled summer flights “to the max” even knowing about air traffic control limits in the Northeast.\n\nUnited said it was getting a handle on its problems.“We’re seeing continued meaningful improvement today after an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match separated crews with aircraft,” the airline said in a midday statement. “As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.”Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled – there aren’t many empty seats. Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was canceled this week. So she got creative.Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak. Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando — with a stop in the Florida Keys — on United Express and Silver Airways. \n\nDuran didn’t care when they told her it would be a very small plane.“Just put me on a boat at this point,” she said.Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New York, took four days to get home from a business trip to Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up some mornings not knowing where she was.Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her reservation when she complained about being offered only a $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her pilot, “Captain Dan,” waited in the airport and helped passengers after the flight was canceled.“This is not all Delta’s fault. Their pilots and flight crews were working very hard,” she said. “I blame the FAA. I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands” and not staffing up air traffic control centers sooner.\n\nHendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen the most travelers on Friday — a predicted 2.82 million people.Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West is under threat of unstable weather for the next several days.Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could add to travelers’ difficulties. Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G wireless service.American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all their planes have been retrofitted with new radio altimeters — those are devices that measure the plane’s height above the ground — and they do not expect disruptions due to 5G service.However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can’t get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility while it works to upgrade them through the summer.The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets. Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights operated to the United States by foreign carriers. By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first three days of the week.']",10,15,8,0
